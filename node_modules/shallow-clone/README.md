var clone = require('shallow-clone');
```

## shallow clones arrays

The array itself is cloned, but not the elements of the array. So any objects in the array will still not be cloned (e.g. they will be the same object as in the orginal array).

```js
var arr = [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]
var foo = clone(arr);
// foo =>  [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]

// array is cloned
assert.equal(actual === expected, false);
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
const clone = require('shallow-clone');
```

**Supports**

* array buffers
* arrays
* buffers
* dates
* errors
* float32 arrays
* float64 arrays
* int16 arrays
* int32 arrays
* int8 arrays
* maps
* objects
* primitives
* regular expressions
* sets
* symbols
* uint16 arrays
* uint32 arrays
* uint8 arrays
* uint8clamped arrays

## Arrays

By default, only the array itself is cloned (shallow), use [clone-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/clone-deep) if you also need the elements in the array to be cloned.

```js
const arr = [{ a: 0 }, { b: 1 }];
const foo = clone(arr);
// foo =>  [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]

// array is cloned
assert(actual === expected); // false

=======
>>>>>>> b9690f13ae0b02552662ffbd680e2069f9283c9e

// array elements are not
assert.deepEqual(actual[0], expected[0]); // true
```

## returns primitives as-is

```js
clone(0)
//=> 0

clone('foo')
//=> 'foo'
```

## shallow clone a regex

```js
clone(/foo/g)
//=> /foo/g
```

## shallow clone an object

```js
clone({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 })
//=> {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
```

## Objects

Only the object is shallow cloned, use [clone-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/clone-deep) if you also need the values in the object to be cloned.

```js
console.log(clone({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }));
//=> {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
```

## RegExp

Clones regular expressions and flags, and preserves the `.lastIndex`.

```js
const regex = clone(/foo/g); //=> /foo/g
// you can manually reset lastIndex if necessary
regex.lastIndex = 0;
```

## Primitives

Simply returns primitives unchanged.

```js
clone(0); //=> 0
clone('foo'); //=> 'foo'
```
